# Conclusion
conclusion = """
--- Key Insights:

1. Brand Attachment: Customers who received free samples tend to purchase more from certain brands. The top brands benefiting from sampling are clearly visible in the brand attachment visualization.
2. Product Attachment: Specific products have a higher probability of being purchased after a sample. The top 10 products list highlights the most effective sampled products.
3. Repurchase Rate: A significant portion of customers who received a sample made additional purchases later, indicating strong conversion potential.
4. Time to Conversion: Most conversions happen on the same day (0 days), suggesting impulse buying or immediate adoption. Some customers take slightly longer, but the trend leans heavily toward quick conversion.

--- Conclusion:

- Sampling Strategy Works: The data suggests that providing free samples is an effective marketing strategy to drive immediate purchases.
- Optimizing Sampled Products: Brands should focus on the highest converting products for sampling to maximize ROI.
- Encouraging Repeat Purchases: Additional engagement strategies (discounts, reminders) could help retain sampled customers for long-term value.
